WEEK2: CRUD
1. crud and the mongo shell
   CRUD: create -> insert, read -> find, update ->update delete -> remove

   MOngoDB's crud operations exist as methods/functions in programming language APIs,
   not as a separate language.

2. Secret of the mongo shell:
    >for(i = 0; i < 3; i++) print(somthing)

    >help

3. BSON:
   how mongodb represent data.

   document oriented.

   use the binary representation of the data to store
   NUmberInt(1)
   NumberLong(1)
   new Date()
   BSON has a lot more data type that javascript can support, like floating point number, timestamps or something else.

4. Insert Doc:
   document, in javascript it is represented as a object.
   The database has a lot of collections, the collection is like a table in the RDBMS.
   The collection is a set of documents.
   >db
   >db.people.insert(doc)
   >db.people.find() // all of the doc inside
     _id: when insert, the server require the doc to have an unique identified field.
          it is a primary key. And it is imuttable.
          require the mongodb id to be unique in the collection.
          If you doesn't fill the _id, the server will generate one and insert it into your document.

5. findOne
   db.people.findOne()
   db.people.findOne({name:'John'})
   db.people.findOne({name:'John'}, {'name': true, '_id':false}) // second one is used for show
   // the _id will show in default

6. find
   db.people.find()
   the server will use the cursor to show, and the cursor by default, it will close in 10 mins.
