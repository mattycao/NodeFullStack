File System:
1. in path, it will not determine the validation of the path. In fs, it offers an method
   fs.exists()
   This is asynchronized I/O.
   so it need be used as follow:
      fs.exists('/etc/passwd', function (exists) {
        util.debug(exists ? "it's there" : "no passwd!");
      });

   will be deprecated, since just use the fs.open and handle the error in there.
