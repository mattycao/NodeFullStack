INTRO:
1. ip: 123.57.143.189
2. write by javascript which run on the server side
3. Why nodeJS? event-drive and unblock IO.
4. Single Process running.
5. module development by using the COMMONJS
6. Event drive results in asynchronous programming.
7. This asynchronous programming accomplished by the event loop:
   mainly two functions: 1) event detection 2) event handler
   At most one event handler is running at any given time
   Any event handler will run to completion without being interrupt
8. Because of closure, event-driven programming doesn't need to keep the state.

MODULE LOAD:
1. a core module -> loading a file module(absolute or relative path) -> loading a folder module(first find the main in packjson, if not, find the index.js -> find inside the node_module folder up to the root node module.
2. The module will be cached as the first time when they are loaded.
   require() it is an synchronous function.

MAIN MODULE:
  buffer, console, events, fs, http, net, querystring, repl(Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop), stream, url, util
  Buffer, setTimeOut, clearTimeOut, setInterval, clearInterval, require, module and process object, (global) object

REPL:
 the same with the eval() function, it evaluate the js as a string
 _ refer the the previous return value
 CODE
    var repl = require('repl');
    var server = repl.start({});
    var con = server.context;
